**Game Library Management System**

This repository contains a C++ project developed as part of academic coursework to demonstrate core programming concepts, data handling, and object-oriented design. The system provides a functional collection of video games, creators, and groupings.

**Overview**

This project was designed to consolidate and apply foundational programming skills in C++. It allows users to add, view, and manage a library of games through a simple command-line interface. The system emphasizes code structure, usability, and modular design.
Features

    Add and store game entries with relevant attributes (e.g. title, genre, platform).

    Display a list of all games in the library.

    Basic search and filtering functionality.

    User interaction via a menu-driven interface.

**Project Highlights**

    Written entirely in C++ using object-oriented principles.

    Emphasizes modularity, code clarity, and reusability.

    Developed in collaboration with a team member, showcasing effective teamwork and communication.

**Concepts Demonstrated**

    Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, encapsulation)

    File I/O operations for persistent data storage

    Data structures (e.g. arrays, vectors)

    Menu systems and input validation

**Tools & Technologies Used**

    C++

    Standard Template Library (STL)

    Basic terminal/console I/O

    Any IDE of your choice (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks)
